## Technology
1. **Bloc**  
   A state management library that simplifies the control of the application's state, ensuring a more predictable and testable environment.
2. **Retrofit with Dio**  
   A combination of powerful HTTP clients used to handle complex API requests, including pagination and data serialization, ensuring smooth data processing.
3. **MVVM Architecture**  
   The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern helps in separating the user interface from the business logic, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.
4. **Json Serializable**
   Automatically generates code to convert Dart objects to and from JSON format, making it easier to work with APIs and ensuring type-safe JSON serialization and deserialization.
5. **Get It**
   Is a simple and lightweight dependency injection package for Dart and Flutter. It allows you to manage the creation and lifecycle of objects, making it easy to retrieve instances of classes (like services or repositories) from anywhere in your app, promoting better code organization and testability.
